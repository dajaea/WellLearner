PURPOSE:

WellLearner Explorer exists to give schools, public agencies, and curious individuals a look at mental health among populations of students and adults, amid the current health crisis.

QUESTIONS:

In what ways might individuals' mental and emotional well-being vary with their levels of educational attainment?  

Especially relevant and societally challenging are potential influences of factors such as remote schooling and living alone as well as with others, at various life stages during the crisis. 

However, these mental health conditions are already prevalent in our society, giving these numbers some significance going into the survey.

In addition to analysis, this survey data can more directly help by identifying populations affected here and now.

DATA SOURCE: HOUSEHOLD PULSE SURVEY

To rapidly monitor recent changes in mental health, the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) partnered with the Census Bureau on an experimental data system called the Household Pulse Survey. This 20-minute online survey was designed to complement the ability of the federal statistical system to rapidly respond and provide relevant information about the impact of the coronavirus pandemic in the U.S.
