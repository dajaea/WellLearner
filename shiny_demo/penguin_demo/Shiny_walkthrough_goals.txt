1. Create a new Shiny project - using the multiple file format.
2. Create a new script and save as global.R in the same folder as ui.R and server.R.
3. Move the library imports into the global.R file.
4. Change datasets to the one from penguins.csv.
5. Covert the histogram to a ggplot showing the distribution of body mass.
6. Add a new plot - a bar chart showing the counts of male vs. female penguins.
7. Convert to shinydashboard so that we can use boxes to control plot sizes.
8. Make the plots depend on the island chosen.
9. Convert the bar chart to a plotly plot.
10. Add a datatable showing the dataset in a new row.
11. Instead of just displaying the dataset, allow the user to upload and read in data and show that data in the table.
